    <h1>Assignment 2: Fade!</h1>

      <img src="circut_a2.jpg" id="images"/>
      <p> Below is all the documentation for assignment 2!
        To my left is my circut board </p>

      <h2>My Schematic:</h2>
      <img src="schematic_a2.jpg" id="images">
      <p>For my schematic, the first one on the left represents the pushbutton schematic.
        For that, I used a resistor of 10k because we were told thats best practice during class.
        For my pins 12, 11, 10, I used a 100 resistor for the blue LED, and 220 resistor for the red and green
        LEDS. I chose that based off my calculations below and chose the ones closest to my calculations
        values. 
      </p>

      <h3>My Firmware:</h3>

      <pre><code>
const int buttonPin = 2;
int buttonState = 0;

void setup() {
 
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin); // reads button pins state (High or Low)
  if (buttonState == HIGH) { // if the button state is High (being pressed), will run code
    digitalWrite(10, HIGH); //turns on LED 10 (red)
    digitalWrite(11, HIGH); // turns on LED 11 (blue)
      for (int brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness -= 10) { 
       	analogWrite(11, brightness); // changes blue brightness from 255 to 0
        delay(75); // will delay each change in bright by 0.1 seconds
      }
      delay(500); // delays for 0.5 seconds
      digitalWrite(11, LOW); // turns off blue LED
      digitalWrite(10, LOW); // turns off red LED
      buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
      if (buttonState == HIGH) {
        digitalWrite(12, HIGH); // turns on blue LED
        delay(500); // delays for 0.5 seconds
        for (int brightness = 0; brightness < 255; brightness += 10) { 
       		analogWrite(11, brightness); // turns green LED from 0 to 255
          delay(75); // delays every 0.075 seconds
        }
        digitalWrite(12, LOW); // turns Green LED off
        digitalWrite(11, LOW); // turns bue LED off
    } else { // if button not being pressed will run code
      for (int i = 10; i < 13; i++) {
    	  digitalWrite(i, LOW); // turns all LEDS off
      }
    }
  }
}
      </code></pre>
      <p>For my code, I used digitalWrite to turn on the LEDs to HIGH and then I used the 
        analogWrite to fade them to 0. I did this so there was a noticeable change in the fade.
        My circut goes from purpleto red and then blue to yellow.
      </p>
      <h4>My Circut's operation:</h4>
      <img src="circut_gif_a2.gif" id="images">
      <p>My circut first starts with the blue and red light on, and then it fades the blue light to 0
        so only red is showing. Then the blue turns on and the green fades from 0 to 255, turning the 
        LED from blue to yellow. I did this so you could noticably see the colors fade from one to another.

      <h5>Additional Questions</h5>
      <p id="Q">Q1: Draw a chart where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage. Draw 3 lines representing the voltage
        across an LED with analogWrite(led, 64), analogWrite(led, 128), and analogWrite(led,255).</p>
        <img src="q1_a2.jpg" id="images">
        <p>For my graph, all the LEDs would be red, but I used different colors to easily see 
          them on the graph. When it's at analogWrite(led, 64), it would be at full brightness 25% of the time, 
          at analogWrite(led, 128) it would be full brightness 50% of the time and analogWrite(led, 255)
          is full brightness all the time. </p> 
      <p id="Q">Q2: Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs,
        how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?</p>
      <img src="q2_a2.jpg" id="images">
      <p>I figured this out by first finding how much current was going through each LED. Then because the LEDs are in parallel,
        I added the currents together to get a total current of 46mA. Then to find the battery life, I divided the 
        1200mAh battery by the 46mA current where the mA would cancel out, to get a total of about 26 hours of battery
        life for that circut.
