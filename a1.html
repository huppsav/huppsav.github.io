    <h1>Assignment 1: Blink!</h1>
    <div class="header">

      <p> Below is all the documentation for assignment 1!
        To my left is my circut board </p>

      <h2>My Schematic:</h2>
      <img src="schematic_a1.jpg" id="images">
      <p>Using the V = IR equation where V is 5V, the LED drop is 1.8 and I is 20mA, I plugged in those values
        and got 5V - 1.8V = 20mA*R. After reducing that down I got, 3.3V = .02A* R. After dividing voltage by
        Current, I got a resistance of 165. Since I didn't have a resistance of 165 in my pack, I went higher
        to make sure the current didn't get too high and went with a resistor of 220.

      <h3>My Firmware:</h3>

      <pre><code>

        void setup() {
          // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
           pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
           pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
           pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
        }
        
        // the loop function runs over and over again forever
        void loop() {
          // turns on port 13 (LED 1) on
          digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
          delay(1000); // wait 1 second
          // turn LED 1 off
          digitalWrite(13, LOW);
          // Turns on port 12 (LED 2) at the same time
          digitalWrite(12, HIGH);
          delay(1000); // wait 1 second
          // turns off LED 2
          digitalWrite(12, LOW);
          // Turns on port 8 (LED 3) at the same time 
          digitalWrite(8, HIGH); 
          delay(1000); // wait for a second
          // Turn off LED 3 
          digitalWrite(8, LOW);  
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>My code turns on one LED at a time, waits a second, and then turns that LED off, while
        turning another one on for 1 second. This loop will repeat over and over again while turning
        on all 3 LEDS independantly.
      </p>
      <h4>My Circut's operation:</h4>
      <img src="circut_board_gif.gif" id="images">
      <p>For my LEDs, i had them blink in a pattern 1 at a time. I started with LED 1,
        then LED 2, and then LED 3. Every second one LED wuld turn on while the one before 
        it would turn off. I chose to do this pattern because then it would be very clear
      that all LEDs could blink independently </p>

      <h5>Additional Questions</h5>
      <p id="Q">Q1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs.
         Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs</p>
        <img src="q1_a1.jpg" id="images">
        <p>MAt second 0, the LED 1 will be on since it starts at high voltage automatically, then as you go to 
          second 1, LED 1 will drop to low voltage (0) and LED 2 will rise to high voltage. At second 2, the LED 2 will drop
          to low voltage (0) and LED 3 will raise to high voltage. Then at second 3, LED 3 wil drop to low voltage and LED 1 will
          be back to high voltage (3.2). My highest voltage is 3.2V on this graph because there was 5V of power to my LEDS
          but the red LEDS have a 1.8V drop so the highest they could be is 3.2 V
        </p> 
      <p id="Q"> Q2: How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?</p>
      <p>There are 13 total ports on our Arduino so we could independently blink 13 LEDS. That would draw approximately 189mA of current. To figure that out,
        I did V=I*R where V=5V-1.8V = 3.2V and R=220 (resistor I used earlier). After plugging everything in, I got 3.2V=I*220
        and I=0.01455A or 14.55mA. Then I multiplied 12 LEDS by 14.55mA of current to get about 189mA. Below is a photo of my work

      <p id="Q"> Q3: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</p>
      <p>You need to blink your LEDs at 10, or 0.1 seconds, to be able to no longer be able to see them blinking</p>
