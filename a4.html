      <p>Below is all the documentation for assignment 4!
        To my left is my circut board</p>

      <h2>My Schematic:</h2>
      <img src="schematic_A4.jpg" id="images">
      <p>In my schematic I used a 1 million resistor for the capactive sensing because in the slides it says 1 megaohm is best for absolute touch 
        activation and thats what I wanted. My capactive sensor is connected to pins 4 and 2 when 4 is the sending pin and 2 is the recieving pin. My servo is then
        attached to pin 9.
      </p>
      <h3>My Firmware:</h3>

      <pre><code> 
        #include <CapacitiveSensor.h> // The capacitive touch library
        #include <Servo.h> // servo motor library
        Servo myServo;
        CapacitiveSensor   cs_4_2 = CapacitiveSensor(4,2);  // 1 megohm resistor between pins 4 & 2, pin 2 is sensor pin, add wire, metal thing
            
        void setup() {
            cs_4_2.set_CS_AutocaL_Millis(0xFFFFFFFF); 	// turn off autocalibrate on channel 1 - just as an example
           myServo.attach(9); // attach servo motor to pin 9
            Serial.begin(9600); 
        }
            
        void loop() {
            long start = millis();
            long total1 =  cs_4_2.capacitiveSensor(30); // value for sensor output
            if (total1 > 1000) { // if the capacitive sensor is being touched, move the servo motor (too 180)
            myServo.write(180); // set angle to 180 degrees
          } else { // if not being touched, put back to 0 degrees
            myServo.write(0); // put back to 0 degrees
            }
              
            Serial.print(millis() - start);    	// check on performance in milliseconds
            Serial.print("\t");                	// tab character for debug window spacing    
            Serial.println(total1);            	// print sensor output 1
            delay(100);                         // arbitrary delay to limit data to serial port
        }    
      </code></pre>
      <p>My code uses the Capactive Sensor library and the Servo motor library. It'll use the capacitive touch to check if there is someone touching the sensor,
        and if someone is, then the servo motor will move. 
      </p>
        <p></p>
      <h4>My Circut's operation:</h4>
      <img src="circut_A4_gif.gif" id="images">
      <p>When you touch the key, the servo motor will move 180 degrees and if you let go of the key, then the servo motor will go back to 0 degrees.
        I did this because then there is a dramatic change in degree on the servo motor and you can easily tell what happens when the key is being touched
        vs. not touched.

      <h5>Additional Questions</h5>
      <p id="Q">Q1:Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. In your loop() you have the following code:
        for (int i=0, i<180, i++){servo.write(i); delay(100);} Draw a graph with the X axis in seconds, for two seconds, and the y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.</p>
        <p>About every 20 ms the servo motor will reset, meaning that it will flucuate between 0 and 5V about 5 times every 1 second. In my graph, I drew 5 peaks for
          every second to represent the servo motor hitting peak voltage at angle 180, then going back down to 0V for angle 0.</p> 
        <img src="q1_A4.jpg" id="images">
      <p id="Q">Q2: Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous reading 1% of the time. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</p>
      <p> You could adress this by calibrating you input device. This would adjust the sensor value to a more accurate reading value since it'll collect values for a few seconds and pick
        a value that's more accurate of the overall values of the sensor rather than the 1% of the time. Below is pseudo code for this 
      </p>
      <code>while seconds < 5 
        sensorValue = read sensor value
  
        if sensorValue > sensorMax
          sensorMax = sensorValue;
    
        if sensorValue < sensorMin
          sensorMin = sensorValue;</code>
      <p id="Q">Q3:Your input device is slightly noisy, leading the measurement to randomly deviate from the true measurement up or down by 10%. How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.</p>
