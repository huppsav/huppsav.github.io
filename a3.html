      <h2>My Schematic:</h2>
      <img src="schematic_A3.jpg" id="images">
      <p>For my schematic, the first one on the left represents the schematic for the photoresistor.
        For that, I used a resistor of 10k because we were told it's best practice to use large resistors for 
        things such as buttons, photoresistors, etc...For my pins 11, 10, 9, I used a 100 resistor for the blue LED, and 220 resistor for the red and green
        LEDS. I chose that based off my calculations below and chose the ones closest to my calculations
        values. </p>

      <h3>My Firmware:</h3>

      <pre><code>
const int sensorPin = A0;  // pin that the sensor is attached to

int sensorValue = 0;   // the sensor value
int sensorMin = 1023;  // minimum sensor value
int sensorMax = 0;  // max sensor value

void setup()
{
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT); //setting red LED
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT); // setting white LED
  pinMode(10, OUTPUT); //setting blue LED
  Serial.begin(9600); // set data rate
  
  digitalWrite(9, HIGH);

  // calibrate during the first three seconds
  while (millis() < 3000) {
    sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin); // reads the voltage of sensor (number between 0 and 1023)

    // record the maximum sensor value
    if (sensorValue > sensorMax) {
      sensorMax = sensorValue;
    }

    // record the minimum sensor value
    if (sensorValue < sensorMin) {
      sensorMin = sensorValue;
    }
  }
  // signal the end of the calibration period
  digitalWrite(10, LOW); // turn off blue LED
  digitalWrite(11, LOW); // turn off white LED
  digitalWrite(9, LOW); // turn off red LED
}

void loop() {
  sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin); // reads the voltage of sensor (number between 0 and 1023)
  Serial.print("My sensor value is "); 
  Serial.print(sensorValue); 
  Serial.println();
  delay(500);
	if (sensorValue > 650) { // if sensor value is about 650 (lights off/dark so high voltage)
  // in case the sensor value is outside the range seen during calibration
  sensorValue = constrain(sensorValue, sensorMin, sensorMax);
  // apply the calibration to the sensor reading
  sensorValue = map(sensorValue, sensorMin, sensorMax, 0, 255);
  Serial.print("The analog version is ");
  Serial.print(sensorValue); 
  Serial.println();
  
  // fade the LED using the calibrated value:
    analogWrite(10, sensorValue-20); // fade blue LED with sensor value (between 0 and 255) 
    analogWrite(11, sensorValue); // fade white LED with sensor value (between 0 and 255) 
    analogWrite(9, sensorValue); //fade red LED with sensor value (between 0 and 255) 
    } else { // if lights are on turn off all LEDS 
      digitalWrite(10, LOW); // turn off blue
      digitalWrite(11, LOW); // turn off white
      digitalWrite(9, LOW); // turn off red
  }
}
  </code></pre>
      <p>In my code, in the setup there is a calibration period where the photoresistor picks up values
        to get a sense for high and low lighting in my current setting. Once that period is over, it'll check the voltage 
        reading from the sensor, and if it's dark (my finger covering the sensor) then the LEDS will turn on,
        if it's light (I remove my finger) the LEDS will turn off. </p>
        <p>An example output from my code would be "my sensor value is 747" (line break) "The modifed value is 180"</p>
      <h4>My Circut's operation:</h4>
      <img src="circut_A3_gif.gif" id="images">
      <p>When I cover the sensor with my finger all red, blue, and green LEDS in the rgb will turn on, turning
        the LED into what looks like a white light. When I remove my finger, all the LEDS will turn off.

      <h5>Additional Questions</h5>
      <p id="Q">Q1: In your voltage divider, can the variable resistor be either R1 or R2 or does
        it need to be one or the other? Justify your answer with example calculations</p>
        <p>It doesn't matter if the variable resistor is R1 or R2, but you will get different output voltages for placing the variable resistor as R1 or R2 so depending on what you want the output value to be, it would matter. 
          For example if the photoresistor is in the dark, its resistance would be 100,00 ohms (value taken from the graph on L4 slides) so if we put that as either R1 or R2 then the voltage outputted would be very different for both.
          If R2 was the variable resistor then it would output a higher voltage compared to if it were R1 which would output a very low voltage. So it could be either R1 or R2, but if you needed/wanted a higher voltage output
          then you would have to put the variable resistor as R2. Below is the calculations
          for the variable resistor in a ark setting being either R1 or R2. 
        </p>

      <p id="Q">Q2: Draw a graph where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is voltage.
        Plot the voltage at V-measure of your voltage divider of your shared gif.</p>
      <img src="q2_A3.jpg" id="images">
      <p>When my resistor was dark (at seconds 2-3 and 5-6) the voltage was 4.54 V which was calculated above for question 1 where 
        the variable resistor was R2. When there was light (seconds 0-1, 3-4), the voltage was 0. 
      </p>
      <p id="Q">Q3:AnalogWrite and analogRead are respectively 8-bit and 10-bit values.
        Imagine you had 10-bit PWM and a 16-bit analog-to-digital converter instead. How would this change your map() code?
        Explain your answer.</p>
        <p>The current range for a 8-bit AnalogWrite is 0-255, while a 10-bit AnalogRead is 0-1024. If we changed to a 10 bit AnalogRead
          the range would change to 0-1023 while the 16-bit would be 0-65536. This would change our map() code because the map code currently maps to the range of 0-255, 
          however with the higher bit values, the mapping range would need to increase to 0-1023 to account for the increase of reading ranges for an increased 
          bit value for AnalogRead and AnalogWrite.
